# ATM-Simulator
The ATM Simulator is a simple console-based Java project that mimics the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine. It allows users to interact with a menu-driven system and perform essential banking operations using loops, conditions, and user input handling.
ðŸ”¹ Features:

â—˜Check Balance â€“ Displays the current account balance.

â—˜Deposit Money â€“ Allows the user to add money to their account. Invalid amounts (like negative deposits) are rejected.

â—˜Withdraw Money â€“ Enables cash withdrawal if the entered amount is valid and does not exceed the available balance.

â—˜CExit Option â€“ Terminates the program when the user chooses to exit.

ðŸ”¹ Technical Highlights:

â—˜CImplemented using Java fundamentals (variables, loops, conditions, and switch-case).

â—˜CUses a do-while loop for repeating the ATM menu until the user exits.

â—˜CIncorporates input validation to handle incorrect choices, negative deposits, and insufficient funds.

â—˜CInitial balance is set (e.g., â‚¹1000), which changes dynamically as transactions occur.

ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes:

â—˜CPractice in menu-driven programming.

â—˜CHands-on experience with loops (do-while), switch-case, and conditional statements.

â—˜CUnderstanding of basic banking logic in a software simulation.

Reinforcement of scanner-based user input handling in Java.
